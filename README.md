- Provide accurate, up-to-date, and complete information about patients.
- Enable quick access to patient records for more coordinated, efficient care.
- Help healthcare providers more effectively diagnose patients, reduce medical errors, and provide safer care.
- Enable healthcare providers to improve efficiency and meet their business goals.
- Reduce costs through decreased paperwork, improved safety, reduced duplication of testing, and improved health.
